# ProgressionPlus
A mod for Terraria aimed to make some of the most tedious aspects of the game more bearable while staying true to Vanilla content. It is currently only available on 1.3.5.3 TModloader, it will be ported to 1.4 at a later date.

Below you can find an exhaustive list all changes that the mod makes. It is a relatively small mod.
You can download the mod [here](https://github.com/sscolon/ProgressionPlus/releases) or through the 1.3.5.3 Tmodloader mod browser.

## List of Changes
### General
- Increased the player's base movement speed by 50%.
- Increased the player's base mining speed by 100%.
These should help you get through early game much quicker, or what I like to call "the early game hump." 

### New Items
- Added the Distress Beacon, a craftable summon for Martian Madness.
- Added Stardust Core - An item that summons the Stardust Pillar.
- Added Vortex Core - An item that summons the Vortex Pillar.
- Added Solar Core - An item that summons the Solar Pillar.
- Added Nebula Core - An item that summons the Nebula Pillar.

### New Recipes

- Added a recipe for Life Fruit. Available post-Mechanical Bosses.
- Added a recipe for Truffle Worm. Available post-Mechanical Bosses.
- Added recipes to change pre-hardmode ores into hardmode ores.
- Added recipes to "duplicate" buff potions, these all require hardmode materials.
- Added alternative recipes for buff potions that require fishing.

### New Enemy Loot
